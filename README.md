## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been working mainly in PHP Laravel, but also in some python projects. 

My programming journey went from Scratch, through C++, Arduino to Java, Python and finally PHP with Laravel which i have the most experiene in.

Right now im developing Android app in Flutter for my Engineer's Thesis. 

I'd gladly collaborate on some projects (pls be backendðŸ˜Š, I can do some work on frontend, but my design's are terrible ðŸ¤¦).

You can find and message me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakub-kermes-b8486b268/) (Jakub Kermes).
